              Established in 1993, Mechanical Associates&#39; induction into the gate manufacturing industry began with one man&#39;s vision to improve upon the quality of gate fabrication and to provide his clients with a cost-effective final product that would endure the test of time. That conception developed into a formidable company with an impressive market share of the industry. Now twenty years later, Mechanical Associates thrives under the parent company of PGM and has developed proprietary components to their gates which ensures the best product possible for their clients.
              <p>
              Utilizing spinning equipment, Mechanical Associates designed and now produces a domed flap gate. The domed cover provides greater strength than that of a flat plate, thus eliminating welding reinforcement on the flap gate cover. This innovative design allows for lightweight stainless steel flap gates to contend in performance and price with the heavier cast iron competitors.
              <p>
              Moreover, subsequent products have supplemented Mechanical Associates product line. Circular, square and rectangular canal and slide gates are available with rubber seals and stainless steel, aluminum or painted steel frames. Additional products include a combination stainless steel slide and flap gate, a PVC line gate and painted carbon/stainless steel ditch gates.
              <p>
